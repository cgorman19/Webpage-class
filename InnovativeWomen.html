    	   	 <h4>Laserphaco Probe:</h4>
    	    	<p>Dr. Patricia Bath's discovered an new way for cataract surgery and invented the devices known as
    	    	 the Laserphaco Probe. It was invented to help people with cataracts, cloudy blemishes that form in
    	    	 the lens of the eye which can lead to burry vision and blindness. This probe is inverted into a tiny 
    	     	incision in the eye and it vaporises the  cataract within a few minutes. Bath spent five years of her
    	    	 life researching and inventing the Laserphaco Probe and it paid off.
    	     	<h4>Ophthalmologist:</h4>
    	    	 Dr. Bath was the first African American women to finish a residency in ophthalmology. Later, 
    	    	 she became the first female faculty member in the Department of Ophthalmology at UCLA's Jules 
    	    	 Stein Eye Institute. A year later in 1976 she co founded the American Institute for the Prevention 
    	     	 of Blindness.</p>
